Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.

The player assumes the identity of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former agent of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He had witnessed events at the Battle of Wounded Knee that changed him, leading to excessive drinking and gambling; he was subsequently dismissed for behavior beyond the acceptable bounds of the Agency. He is hired by mysterious individuals, aware of Columbia's location, and tasked to infiltrate the air-city and rescue a young woman named Elizabeth, who has been held aboard the air-city for the last twelve years. Completing the task and returning Elizabeth to New York City would clear Booker of \"old debts\", but this would be his last chance to clear them.\r\n\r\nBooker is taken by boat to an island lighthouse near Maine that houses a rocket silo, from which he is taken to Columbia. His arrival there is initially quiet; he is baptized by the population before allowed to explore the city. However, while at a carnival, one citizen notices a tattoo on Booker's wrist, with the letters \"AD\", a sign of a \"false shephard\" that will bring Comstock's downfall by taking away his \"lamb\", purportedly Elizabeth. Booker becomes a target of Comstock's forces from this discovery, and he is forced into the conflict of the city while still seeking Elizabeth. Though Booker finds Elizabeth easily enough, he quickly discovers that Elizabeth is central to the civil war raging in the city, her rescue being the start of the chain of events that ultimately lead to Columbia's down-fall. Elizabeth, when first rescued, is meek and timid, and only just coming to grasp her abilities with her powers, but as she is escorted by Booker, becomes bolder and more confident, shown through both physical appearance and her changes in outfit. Each faction seeks to use Elizabeth to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor; the Founders believe Elizabeth's powers can help end the conflict and place them back in control, while the Vox Populi would rather kill Elizabeth than allow the Founders to get their hands on her, believing a prophecy that if Elizabeth falls, so does Columbia. Booker and Elizabeth are forced to place their trust in one another in order to escape. Elizabeth also seeks to understand the powers that she has been given, believing Comstock to be responsible, and refuses to leave Columbia until she learns the truth. Booker comes to fear the power that Elizabeth possesses; a scene during one of the game's preview trailers shows Booker to be more afraid of Elizabeth than God. To complicate matters, the pair is chased by Songbird, a large, robotic bird-like creature who had been Elizabeth's friend and warden over the last twelve years of her imprisonment. Songbird was designed by its creator to feel betrayal should Elizabeth escape, comparable to an abusive spouse, according to Hilary Goldstein of IGN, and Elizabeth notes she \"would rather be killed than be recaptured by Songbird.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the internal strife, Columbia is ravaged by tears in the fabric of space-time. The game begins with a quote from a fictional work Barriers to Trans-dimensional Travel purportly published in 1889. A strange shimmering effect as seen by Booker causes momentary changes to pictures, banners, and people, representing the nearby presence of a tear; in one example, Booker, while watching a Founder give a speech, experiences a brief shimmer where a patriotic button on the Founder's jacket briefly changes to that of the hammer and sickle associated with Communism. The tears have brought seemingly anachronistic elements into the Columbia of 1912; for example, an early gameplay demo footage features a record player in a bar plays a woman singing the lyrics to Tears for Fears' 1985 song \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\"; a later press reveal included similar covers of 1933's \"Goodnight, Irene\" by Huddie Ledbetter, sung in chorus by a large group of Columbia's citizens, 1966's \"God Only Knows\" by The Beach Boys, sung by a barbershop quartet, and 1983's \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" by Cyndi Lauper. 1UP.com's preview of the 2011 E3 game demonstration denotes that at one point, Booker and Elizabeth find themselves in 1983, evident by a movie marquee showing Revenge of the Jedi (the original working name for Return of the Jedi), a result of a misfire of Elizabeth's powers involving tears in the fabric of space-time when she tries to help revive a horse. The scene was part in a media preview event in December 2012, though in this case, the events occurred within a test laboratory, with Elizabeth expressing an interest in going to Paris and opening a rift to see the marquee for the film in French (La Revanche du Jedi).\r\n\r\nLevine has stated that the ending of Infinite is \"like nothing you've experienced in a video game before\"; the story purposely avoids a problem that arose from the original BioShock in which, after the death of Andrew Ryan in the middle of the game, \"the story loses some of its steam\".\r\n\r\nThough the game takes place before the events of the previous two BioShock games (occurring in 1960 and 1968, respectively), Irrational Games has not confirmed if BioShock Infinite shares the same universe with these titles; Ken Levine left the question of the possibility unanswered in an interview stemming from the game's announcement."],"count":0,"genre":"Shooter","rating":["7.4375"]},{"thumb":{"url":"http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/back/4174-1.jpg"},"id":"4174","name":"System Shock 2","description":["The story begins in 2114, forty-two years after the events of System Shock.

With them comes the Palanquin Ship, a flying vessel captained by Murasa. Shou, Murasa, and Ichirin then vow to rescue Byakuren Hijiri from her seal in Hokkai. Unfortunately, the fragments of the floating vault, one of the pieces necessary for Byakuren's revival, were scattered all over the place by a prank of Nue's, where she planted the seeds of unknown form into the pieces(the youkai didn't know what the others were planning, but thought it would be funny if they failed). In addition, Shou loses the pagoda of Bishamonten - the second piece necessary for unsealing the monk - and sends Nazrin to find it.\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\nThe story of Undefined Fantastic Object starts in earnest in early spring, after the snow begins to melt, with rumors around Gensokyo of a strange flying object in the skies. Believing the Palanquin Ship to be a treasure ship, Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame are prompted to chase after it. In turn, they are followed by Sanae Kochiya.\r\n\r\nMAIN SCENARIO\r\nThe heroine first runs into Nazrin, who is busy searching for the pagoda using her dowsing rods. Since the heroine has already collected some of the pieces of the floating vault (in the form of perceived UFOs), Nazrin decides that the heroine is worth the effort to fight. However, she ultimately loses, and manages to escape in the end, settling on finding just the pagoda. It is known that she finds it between now and stage 4 or 5 at a second-hand shop, which could be referring to Kourindou. \r\n\r\nStill chasing the flying ship, the heroine then meets Kogasa Tatara, a youkai with no relevance to the story. After the youkai fails to scare the heroine, she is promptly defeated in a high-speed battle. \r\n\r\nOnce the heroine reaches the Palanquin Ship, she meets Ichirin and Unzan, who are standing guard outside the ship itself. Many fairies and youkai have been swarming around because of the rumors that there is treasure on board, but Ichirin assures the main character that this is not the case. The heroine beats the pair and enters the ship. \r\n\r\nInside the ship, the heroine has her first encounter with Nue, who is concealing her true form at the moment. After she retreats, the heroine meets the captain, Murasa, who reveals that the ship is currently on its way to Makai under autopilot. The main characters generally react poorly to this, though no further mention is made of the older Touhou games. Murasa attempts to battle the heroine, again in order to wrest the fragments of the floating vault away, but in the end she assumes that the heroine is on their side and is trying to help. \r\n\r\nOnce in Makai, the heroine disembarks, only to be overtaken by Nazrin once again. The mouse youkai has found the pagoda, and decides to test it out before giving it to her master, Shou. The heroine beats the two of them, and finally decides to break the seal on Hokkai out of pure curiosity. \r\n\r\nAfter the seal is broken, Byakuren appears to the heroine. A friend to all youkai and humans, she and the main character have a battle of words, but one way or another, they end up fighting. Once the heroine wins, it is implied that everyone leaves Makai(and Byakuren is not sealed away again)."],"count":0,"genre":"Shooter"},{"thumb":{"url":"http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/24000-1.jpg"},"id":"24000","name":"Cool Herders","description":["Cool Herders is an addictive 2D multiplayer game that pits you against up to three friends in a game that can only be described as \"Cool.\" Your goal is to collect the most sheep in a round, either by herding them yourself or by bashing your opponent and stealing his or her sheep!
